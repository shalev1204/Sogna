# Avalonia ViewModels with Zafiro

This skill provides a set of best practices and patterns for creating ViewModels, Wizards, and managing navigation in Avalonia applications, leveraging the power of **ReactiveUI** and the **Zafiro** toolkit.

## Principles

1. **Functional-Reactive Approach**: Use ReactiveUI (`ReactiveObject`, `WhenAnyValue`, etc.) to handle state and logic.
2. **Enhanced Commands**: Utilize `IEnhancedCommand` for better command management, including progress reporting and name/text attributes.
3. **Wizard Pattern**: Implement complex flows using `SlimWizard` and `WizardBuilder` for a declarative and maintainable approach.
4. **Automatic Section Discovery**: Use the `[Section]` attribute to register and discover UI sections automatically.
5. **Clean Composition**: map ViewModels to Views using `DataTypeViewLocator` and manage dependencies in the `CompositionRoot`.

## Guides

- [ViewModels & Commands](viewmodels.md): Creating robust ViewModels and handling commands.
- [Wizards & Flows](wizards.md): Building multi-step wizards with `SlimWizard`.
- [Navigation & Sections](navigation_sections.md): Managing navigation and section-based UIs.
- [Composition & Mapping](composition.md): Best practices for View-ViewModel wiring and DI.

## Example Reference

For real-world implementations, refer to the **Angor** project:

- `CreateProjectFlowV2.cs`: Excellent example of complex Wizard building.
- `HomeViewModel.cs`: Simple section ViewModel using functional-reactive commands.
