 * Create a press gesture.

 * click and multitouch.
 *
 * It also adds accessibility support for keyboards, where
 * an element with a press gesture will receive focus and
 *  trigger on Enter `"keydown"` and `"keyup"` events.
 *
 * This is different to a browser's `"click"` event, which does
 * respond to keyboards but only for the `"click"` itself, rather
 * than the press start and end/cancel. The element also needs
 * to be focusable for this to work, whereas a press gesture will
 * make an element focusable by default.
